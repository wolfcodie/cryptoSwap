          Integration partners with in-house support who prefer to be the main
          point of contact with their users can continue to do so. If this is
          preferred we create shared communication channels between our support
          teams. <a href=""> Reach out to us </a>to set this up.

        Is it safe for users to shift via my SideShift.ai integration?

      {faq[8] && (
        <p>
          SideShift.ai aims to minimize third-party risk as much as possible.
          SideShift.ai only holds control of your funds during the exchange
          process. In the unlikely event an exchange cannot be processed,
          SideShift.ai will request a refund address and issue a refund.

        How fast are integration shifts processed?
      </button>
      {faq[9] && (
        <p>
          Shift speeds vary from coin to coin and are based on the number of
          confirmations required. SideShift.ai is focused on decreasing shift
          times as much as possible. Integration exchange speeds are exactly the
          same as those experienced by users shifting directly with
          SideShift.ai.
